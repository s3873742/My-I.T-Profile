<p style="color:purple;font-family:arial">I was born in Australia, but my parents were born in England and moved here in the 1970’s. As a result, I had an English accent till the end of primary school, and people jokingly used to say I sounded like Posh Spice. I love art and have been drawing and painting since I was little. My work has ranged from realistic, to splashes of paint on a canvas, and everything in between. I also really love cars, and currently own a Subaru WRX.

<h3 style="color:MediumOrchid;">Interest in I.T</h3>
<p style="color:purple;">My interest in I.T stemmed from a strong desire to understand how technology works. This began about 7 years ago when I started working on the helpdesk of a software company. I came to enjoy the troubleshooting aspect of it and would often test things in my downtime to fill gaps in my knowledge. I also really enjoyed writing technical guides and documentation on how to perform certain processes, and found it quite rewarding to not only solve problems for clients but teach them new or better ways of doing something using technology. My experience is somewhat limited in that work was more-so related to the software itself rather than the computer or programs running on it, but by proxy I learned a range of skills such as the process of troubleshooting by elimination (which largely comes down to knowing the right questions to ask), the software testing process, knowledge of client-server systems, and the basic concepts of database maintenance and repair. 
I chose RMIT for its long-standing reputation as being a leading technical higher education institution in Australia. The ability to enroll in this subject and Intro to Programming without the need for pre-requisites was great in that I get exposure to a variety of different subjects in the tech industry, thus helping me to decide which area I would like to focus on in future. Their flexibility in terms of online offerings was also a huge plus for me, as it enables me to continue working full time. 
I would expect to have knowledge in most areas of I.T by the end of my studies, and particularly in areas that are set to expand in the coming years, such as cloud based applications and AI. If I went on to do the degree, I would hope that I would have great expertise in one or two key areas that particularly resonated with me, or drew on my existing strengths and likes.

<h3 style="color:MediumOrchid;">Ideal Job</h3>

<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50543942?type=standout#searchRequestToken=0708ce65-b2a7-4cbc-b39d-913ab137e08d">Software Tester Job Advertisement</a>

<p style="color:purple;">This role involves providing testing and quality assurance for a product called HammerTech. I find this position interesting as it would draw on my previous exposure to software testing, and my own love of perfectionism and attention to detail. It requires previous experience in web application testing, working with agile methodology, skills in html/css, experience with agile software development processes, automated test development, and JIRA/BrowserStack tools. It also requires a high level of verbal and written communication skills which would be required to understand the feature requirements expressed by the product managers, and bug reports from customers. I currently already possess the requirements of having excellent verbal and written communication skills, interpersonal skills, and being a self-starter. At this time I don’t possess the other skills and experience they require for the role, other than some experience in software application testing. I would gain the necessary skills and experience by learning how to use the particular programs they had mentioned, perhaps undertaking certificates or courses in these to demonstrate proficiency. I would learn html and css, and perhaps try and work at an entry level for a software company using agile methodologies, to gain some real world experience.

<h3 style="color:MediumOrchid;">Personal Profile</h3>

<p style="color:purple;">According to the Myers Briggs Type Indicator for personalities, I am an INFP. You can read more about this type here: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality">Who is INFP?</a>
  
The results of the Meyers Briggs have indicated that I am a quiet, imaginative, kind and creative person, who tries to look for the best in everything in everyone. I would agree with this to some extent, however feel I am more realistic in that good cannot be found in absolutely everything and everyone. I am seemingly dedicated and hard-working, and prefer to seek harmony with others, with no interest in power or leadership. In the context of a team environment, I believe these characteristics mean I’ll be likely to find conflict troublesome, and may end up becoming quiet in times of disagreement, rather than having open and effective discussion about the matter. Given I tend to be on the reserved side, when it comes to forming a team, I think I should seek out team members who are effective listeners and diplomatic in their approach to ensuring everyone gets to contribute evenly.
